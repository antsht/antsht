Greetings, fellow travelers of the multiverse! I am **Anton Shtern**, a wandering technomancer whose journey began amidst the ancient tomes of Yaroslavl State University, where I delved deep into the mysteries of mathematics. But my path diverged into realms both digital and fantastical, where the arcane languages of **C**, **C#**, and **Python** became my spells, and the realm of **MSSQL** my enchanted workshop.

Clad in the robes of a modern-day sorcerer, I seamlessly traverse the realms of code and creativity. With a flick of my fingers, I conjure intricate **3D models** and breathe life into them through the ancient arts of 3d-scanning, 3d-modeling and 3d-printing. Yet, my prowess extends beyond the digital ether; for I am also a master of **cosplay** and **prop-making**, shaping reality itself to mirror the dreams of the imagination.

Certified in the arcane arts of programming and bestowed with the sacred knowledge of **CS50x**, I stand as a guardian of innovation and a harbinger of technological marvels. Fluent in the tongues of both **Russian** and **English**, I bridge the divide between cultures and civilizations.

So, whether you seek the wisdom of algorithms or the wonder of otherworldly craftsmanship, fear not, for **Anton Shtern** is here to guide you through the labyrinthine realms of adventure and innovation!
